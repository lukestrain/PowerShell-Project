README FOR Make Temp Accounts From Excel

This script imports data from an excel sheet to make a new OU and accounts with a set expiration date for a group of people outside the organization that need access to our network.
At Camp Shelby, we frequently had visitors to the base that needed temporary access.
Accounts are set to expire at a date determined in the excel sheet.
I also included an example excel document that shows the format required for it to work.
