These are PowerShell projects I built as part of the Microsoft Server and Cloud Administration Class.

First I wrote a script to remote into a computer, get the last user who used it, then output the user and their phone number. This is helpful in researching what happened with a computer.

Next I made a script that pulls info from an excel to make an OU and temporary users in that OU. This was inspired by my last Army job where we often had units train at our base for short periods of time. They would need temporary accounts. Next step would be to automatically apply a specific security group.

After that I made a script that finds all disabled users, removes them from their extra security groups and adds a note in their description about which groups they were removed from.

Finally I made a Powerhsell module that generates symmetric encryption keys based on Pokemon teams
